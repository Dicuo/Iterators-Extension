# PenguinMod Iterators Extension
An extension that adds iterators to PenguinMod
## To do:
- [x] Make iterators use generators so lambdas can be properly executed
- [x] Fix freezing when iterators take too long to terminate/collect
- [x] Add Block and Argument to divIterator (using jwArray as reference)
- [x] Add handling for improper input (e.g if a block is called with no input if it should be casted, if not what to do)
- [x] Clean the code a bit if possible (might still need some more)
- [ ] Add documentation
- [ ] Create some kind of "iterable" interface for custom types (`iterate over` and `collect to` could be made type-generic!)
- [ ] Add a block for defining custom iterators (Possibly generator style?)
